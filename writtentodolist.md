3: Rhythm/3.3: Techniques For Modifying Rhythm/3.3: Techniques For Modifying Rhythm.md:With rhythms that use random floating point numbers, the durations that are used have no relationship to any central pulse, and will end up cutting across the beat a lot of the time in a way that I feel does not make sense in dance music. Instead, randomness can be incorporated within various techniques (for a great example see the way that Pwhite is used in the section on Euclidean Rhythms), or constrained to fit within a more regular pattern by using methods (which can be found in the [Pattern Documentation](TODO)).

3: Rhythm/3.3: Techniques For Modifying Rhythm/3.3: Techniques For Modifying Rhythm.md:Some great advice I received from a lecturer was 'if one of them is good, lots of them will be great' (paraphrased), when talking about the work of [an artist](TODO: Who is this again?). This works really well when applied to rhythmic percussion, particularly if each layer of similar percussion serves to re-contextualise the last.

3: Rhythm/3.3: Techniques For Modifying Rhythm/3.3: Techniques For Modifying Rhythm.md:A technique that I started using after being inspired by Trap instrumentals (such as Ace Hood's [Bugatti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2KF2JbrQ94)) was hi-hats that snapped between 1/4, 1/8, 1/6 and 1/16th note patterns. The best way I found to do this was to use [Pwrand](TODO: this). Pwrand takes an array of items, and will select those items randomly within a weighted distribution, allowing control over the frequency of occurrence of particular elements.

3: Rhythm/3.3: Techniques For Modifying Rhythm/3.3: Techniques For Modifying Rhythm.md:[Pkey](TODO: this) is a pattern class used to embed the same value multiple times in the same pattern - for example if the release value of a SynthDef needed to be the same as the duration of the note:
3: Rhythm/3.3: Techniques For Modifying Rhythm/3.3: Techniques For Modifying Rhythm.md:One way to use this in rhythm is to create sample playback that flips back and forth. Due to how the [`bplay`](TODO: This) Ugen works, if a buffer is to be played backwards it will need to be started just before the end of the sample as the Synth will release once the sample is finished (for more information see [Ugen done-actions](TODO: this)). Using the `.linlin` linear scaling method this value can then be scaled into the rate of playback to create a back-and-forth pattern in percussion, shown here on a snare:
